# 🌿 GreenDen - Front-End Project

🚀 **Just Completed a Front-End Project!**

I’ve recently built a fully responsive website called **GreenDen** using **HTML** and **Tailwind CSS** — focusing purely on design and layout without any functionality for now.

## 🖥️ Pages Included
- Home  
- Products  
- Contact

This project helped me sharpen my front-end skills and explore the power of utility-first CSS with Tailwind. It’s **mobile-friendly**, cleanly structured, and built with best practices in mind.
